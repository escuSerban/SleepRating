# Sleep Rating
**Sleep Rating** is an Android App that helps you collect information about your sleep.

It stores every sleep duration in a local dataBase; then this records can be observed and analysed in the chartðŸ“Š section.

As a user, you have the option to set up a notification alarm; just to remind you to rate your sleepðŸ’¤ period.

Here is a short video presentation.
